Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!

To play this game, simply run "python tic_tac_toe.py" from your command line - just 
make sure you're running Python 3.9.4 or a higher compatible version.

The game offers a multiplayer mode and an AI opponent. Whether the first
player plays as x or as o is randomly chosen. The AI opponent has two levels
of difficulty. The beginner mode plays at random. The advanced mode attempts
to make winning plays and blocks any potential winning plays of your own. The 
advanced AI is good, but it doesn't play perfectly - so you should be able to 
beat it with some practice. Be careful when playing the AI - you don't get to 
choose who goes first!
